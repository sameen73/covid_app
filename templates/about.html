            This app seeks to make the large corpus of COVID-19 research easily parseable and available to researchers
            and curious individuals alike. There are two features: the COVID-19 ReSearch Engine and the 
            Random Insights Generator. This app uses data pulled from the CORD-19 research challenge on Kaggle. 
          </p> 
          <p>
            The ReSearch Engine uses data from the CORD-19 research challenge on Kaggle. This data contains information about 
            literature pertaining to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The ReSearch Engine utilizes cosine similarity to rank the 
            results in relation to the user query, with the ultimate goal of helping researchers locate relevant papers quickly. 
            The results include the full abstract, cord uid, and paper title. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The Random Insight Generator (RIG) uses a subset of abstracts that are written in a specific form with a clearly
            delineated conclusion sentence. The RIG pulls ten random conclusion sentences as well as their corresponding 
            paper title and cord uid. This part of the app can help curious individuals who want to know what scientists are doing 
            with regard to COVID-19 jump into their own personal quests for factual, scientific evidence. Users can also use the 
            RIG to find topics of interest, then navigate over to the ReSearch Engine to look up papers on the same subject.
