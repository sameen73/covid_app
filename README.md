# Motivations

We wanted to take the analysis from the covid19_research repo and build an end product from it. We created an app that contains 2 main functional pieces: the COVID19 ReSearch Engine, and the Random Insights Generator. 

The ReSearch Engine uses cosine similarity to reverse rank-order the abstracts from most cosine similar to least, displaying cord_uid, title, and full abstract. The Random Insights Generator randomly picks 10 abstracts, and displays their cord_uid, title, and concluding sentence of the abstract (the insight).
